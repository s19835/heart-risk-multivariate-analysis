# Multivariate Analysis of Heart Failure Risk Using PCA, Clustering, and Discriminant Techniques

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. Predicting heart failure risk early can save lives. This study applies multivariate statistical techniques to a real-world heart disease dataset to uncover hidden patterns, reduce dimensions, and cluster patients based on risk factors. The aim is to demonstrate the practical application of PCA, clustering, and discriminant analysis to healthcare analytics.
